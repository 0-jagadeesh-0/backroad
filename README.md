Backroad is a low-code tool that allows Node.JS developers to try out their own tooling/packages or build proof-of-concept apps as quickly as possible.

Backroad provides a simple [streamlit-like](https://streamlit.io/) API and ships with several commonly used components out of the box like form inputs, tables and LLMs. Powered by a top-to-bottom re-run based flow, it allows you to quickly put together applications with a very easy-to-understand interface.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed a relatively recent version of Node.JS

## Installing Backroad

To install Backroad, follow these steps:

```bash
npx degit sudomakes/trybackroad trybackroad
cd trybackroad
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Backroad Example

Here's what a sample backroad script looks like

```js
const [photo] = br.fileUpload({ label: 'Pick Image' });
if (photo) {
  br.write({ body: '# Greyscale image' });
  const image = await Jimp.read(photo.filepath);
  image.greyscale().getBase64(Jimp.AUTO, (err, res) => {
    br.image({ src: res, width: 600 });
  });
}
```

And this is the output you will get in the browser:

As you can probably notice, it takes a relatively small amount of code to get started building and prototyping your ideas with Backroad. To learn more about backroad components and concepts, refer the [docs](https://backroad.sudomakes.art/docs/fundamentals/introduction/)

## Roadmap

### Proposals

üîè <b>Adding authentication</b> - use auth.js to allow per page auth granularity.

üåê <b>SEO improvements</b> - google crawlers can render and crawl react, but websockets are presenting an issue in achieving SEO.

‚òÅÔ∏è <b>One Click Deploy</b> - something similar to streamlit's community cloud to help easy deployments and promote adoption.

### In Progress
üìã <b>Improving file upload UX</b> - allow copy pasting from clipboard instead of having to read from fs
