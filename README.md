## Currently Need to Work On (From highest priority to lowest)

- google analytics integration
- Support for remaining components and documentation
- 404 page for routes which dont exist
- SEO improvements (for blog type pages)
- favicon support, default title support, initial container width, initial sidebar state
- generic types for values of certain components (for example select options should be strongly typeable through generics somehow)
- memoisation constructs for intensive tasks in script
